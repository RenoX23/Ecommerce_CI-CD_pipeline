## 📖 About the Project

The goal of this project is to develop and deploy a **modern e-commerce web application** that includes:
- A responsive product listing page.
- Dockerized backend and frontend.
- Automated deployments through **CI/CD pipelines**.
- Infrastructure provisioning via **Terraform**.

The pipeline automates:
- Code build & testing.
- Docker image building & pushing to Docker Hub.
- Remote server deployment using SSH.
- Infrastructure provisioning with AWS EC2 using Terraform.

## ⚡ CI/CD Pipeline
This pipeline is configured using GitHub Actions.  
It performs the following steps:
1. Checkout code from the repository.
2. Run unit tests and linting.
3. Build Docker image.
4. Push Docker image to Docker Hub.
5. SSH into AWS EC2 and deploy the new image.

### `ci-cd-pipeline.yml` sample:
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  build:
    ...
  deploy:
    ...
```

---

## 🌎 Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
The infrastructure is provisioned using Terraform and includes:
- AWS EC2 instances
- Security Groups (allow SSH and HTTP)
- Remote backend storage (S3 bucket and DynamoDB for state locking)

To deploy:
```bash
cd terraform/
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Terraform CLI
- AWS CLI
